# knowledge

:bulb: document everything

## Rationale

This repository serves as central hub for everything I learn while being a fellow human being.
I strive to learn and add something here every day.

It is intended for myself, but I hope to jot down stuff of broader interest from time to time.

## Install

```shell
git clone https://github.com/marionebl/knowledge.git
```

## Usage

Edit the files with any text editor. For rendering the markdown files you could
use a tool like [vmd](https://github.com/yoshuawuyts/vmd).

## Contributing

or file [pull requests](https://github.com/marionebl/knowledge/compare) any time.
