# Ideas

Ideas for project, libraries and features to implement

## Work in progress
* [ ] configurable `commitlint` bot: https://github.com/ahmed-taj/commitlint-bot

## Done
* [x] Animated SVG renderer for [asciinema](https://github.com/asciinema/asciinema-player) for usage in Github markdown. https://github.com/marionebl/svg-term-cli

## Tools

* [ ] Styleguide creator interface for [patternplate](https://github.com/sinnerschrader/patternplate)
* [ ] Blueant interface (think Google Calender Week View)
* [ ] **lerna-dashbaord**: Webinterface for meta information connected to lerna repos

## Libraries

* [ ] **react-term**: React renderer for terminals striking the middleground between [ink](https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink) and [mylittledom](https://github.com/manaflair/mylittledom) Should support flexbox layouts, event delegation.

## Features

* [ ] **patternplate**: Network visualization of pattern dependencies
* [ ] **@commitlint/prompt**: Inline editing interface
* [ ] **@commitlint/prompt**: Explanations for fields
* [ ] **@commitlint/core**: Perform automatic fixes

## Obsolete
* [ ] ~~[**bankai**](https://github.com/yoshuawuyts/bankai/issues/31) Hot Module Replacement~~
* [ ] ~~dependency-checker bot skimming through npm packages proactively, producing PRs~~ https://renovateapp.com/
