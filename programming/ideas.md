# Ideas

Ideas for project, libraries and features to implement

## Work in progress

* [ ] Animated SVG renderer for [asciinema](https://github.com/asciinema/asciinema-player) for usage in Github markdown. ([WIP](https://github.com/marionebl/asciicast-to-svg/tree/feat/terminal-sequences))
* [ ] **patternplate**: Livereload via SSE ([WIP](https://github.com/sinnerschrader/patternplate/tree/chore/lernaify))

## Tools

* [ ] Styleguide creator interface for [patternplate](https://github.com/sinnerschrader/patternplate)
* [ ] Blueant interface (think Google Calender Week View)
* [ ] **lerna-dashbaord**: Webinterface for meta information connected to lerna repos

## Libraries

* [ ] **react-term**: React renderer for terminals striking the middleground between [ink](https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink) and [mylittledom](https://github.com/manaflair/mylittledom) Should support flexbox layouts, event delegation

## Features

* [ ] [**bankai**](https://github.com/yoshuawuyts/bankai/issues/31) Hot Module Replacement
* [ ] **patternplate**: Network visualization of pattern dependencies
* [ ] **@commitlint/prompt**: Inline editing interface
* [ ] **@commitlint/prompt**: Explanations for fields
* [ ] **@commitlint/core**: Perform automatic fixes
