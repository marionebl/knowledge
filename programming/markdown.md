# Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax designed so that it can be converted to HTML and many other formats.

## Github flavored markdown
*  Github uses `readme.md`, `README.md` to display index pages of directories
*  Other common index names, such as `index.md` are ignored
