# Documentation

Arguably docs are the single most important part of projects you expect people to actually use.

Simply put:

> If people **don’t know why** your project exists,
they won’t use it.

> If people can’t figure out **how to install** your code,
they won’t use it.

> If people can’t figure out **how to use** your code,
they won’t use it.

Keep in mind: This applies to your future self, too.

## Types of documentation

* Getting started
* Reference guide
* Tutorials
* Learning
* Cookbook

## Rules for better writing

*  Know your audience, consider creating a Persona
*  Define the reader's use case
*  Consider the circumstances of use
*  Make the audience/use case definitions part of the docs

## Docs for Open Source projects

Things that should be considered the bare minimum in a readme file:

*  State the place in software life cycle
*  Describe very briefly what it actually does
*  Explain why it exists
*  Define steps to install
*  Show examples of how to use
*  Explain how to contribute
*  State the license
*  Link to related projects

## Beyond the readme

A user starting out with an OSS project has the same fundamental need as on any ole' other website. Toy around with the idea to employ story telling to further steps.
