# Documentation

Docs are the most important part of projects you expect people to use.

> If people **don’t know why** your project exists,
they won’t use it.

> If people can’t figure out **how to install** your code,
they won’t use it.

> If people can’t figure out **how to use** your code,
they won’t use it.

Keep in mind this especially applies to your future self.

## Types of documentation

* Getting started
* Reference guide
* Tutorials
* Learning
* Cookbook

## Rules for better writing

*  Know your audience and create a Persona
*  Define the reader's use case
*  Think about circumstances of use
*  Make definitions part of the docs
*  Short sentences
*  Avoid filler phrases: that, "I think"
*  Avoid gerund and passive constructions
*  Short paragraphs. 3 sentences max

## Docs for Open Source projects

Must haves in a readme:

*  State the place in software life cycle
*  Describe very briefly what it actually does
*  Explain why it exists
*  Define steps to install
*  Show examples of how to use
*  Explain how to contribute
*  State the license
*  Link to related projects

## Beyond the readme

Toy around with the idea to employ story telling to further steps.

An example for this is a getting started guide that displays directly when
a user starts the project for the first time.

I have yet to test the idea extensively. It is live at [patternplate](https://github.com/sinnerschrader/patternplate/blob/02b1eca5568c4ce77b0bf32fe7780a3f3a0b9811/documentation/pattern-development.md) anyway.
 `patternplate init` puts the getting started guide as initial content into new projects.
